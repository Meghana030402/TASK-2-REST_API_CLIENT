# TASK-2-REST_API_CLIENT




Project Overview

This Java-based console application is designed to demonstrate how real-time weather information can be fetched, processed, and displayed using an external weather API. The core idea behind this project is to help learners understand how Java applications interact with online services and work with live data instead of static or hardcoded values. In today’s software world, most applications rely on APIs to fetch data dynamically, and this project introduces that concept in a simple yet practical way.The application communicates with a weather API over the internet, retrieves weather-related information in JSON format, and processes that data to present meaningful output in the console. By keeping the application console-based, the project ensures that the focus remains on backend logic, API communication, and data handling rather than user interface design. This makes it especially suitable for students and beginners who want to strengthen their fundamentals in Java programming.


Features


•	Gets live weather information from an online weather service.
•	Connects to the internet using Java to collect weather data.
•	Reads data that is received in JSON format.
•	Converts raw weather data into meaningful information.
•	Shows weather details clearly in the console.
•	Handles errors safely so the program does not crash.

Languages and Tools Used

•	Java – The primary programming language used to build the entire application. Java provides robustness, platform independence, and strong support for networking and API-based development.
•	JSON Library – Used to parse, read, and manipulate JSON data received from the weather API. It plays a crucial role in converting raw API responses into usable information.
•	Java Development Kit (JDK) – Required for compiling and running the Java source files. It provides essential tools like the Java compiler and runtime environment.
•	IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA) – Used during development for writing code, managing files, debugging errors, and improving productivity.
•	Command Prompt / Terminal – Used to compile and execute the program outside the IDE, helping users understand how Java programs run in real environments.
•	Weather API Service – An external online service that provides live weather data accessed through HTTP requests.


Platforms Used

•	Windows Operating System – Used as the primary development and execution environment.
•	Java Virtual Machine (JVM) – Enables platform-independent execution, allowing the program to run on any system that supports Java.
•	Console-Based Platform – The application runs completely in the command line, requiring minimal system resources and no graphical interface.

 Applications 

•  Can be used to check current weather conditions.
•  Helpful for students learning Java and API integration.
•  Useful in travel planning to know weather conditions in advance.
•  Can support farmers by providing basic weather information.
•  Helpful in transport and delivery planning affected by weather.
•  Can be used as a base for weather-related software projects.
