## DESCRIPTION

# Project Overview

This project is a Java-based console application that demonstrates how to fetch and process real-time weather data from an external API using Java. The application connects to a public Weather API, sends a request based on user input (such as a city name), receives the response in JSON format, and extracts meaningful weather information to display in the console.
The primary goal of this project is to help learners understand how Java applications interact with external web services, handle HTTP requests and responses, and parse JSON data effectively. It bridges the gap between basic Java programming and real-world application development by introducing API communication in a simple and practical way.

# Purpose of the Project

•	To demonstrate how Java can communicate with external APIs

•	To understand HTTP connections and request handling

•	To parse and process JSON responses in Java

•	To display real-time data in a readable console format

•	To introduce real-world backend concepts using Core Java

# Features

•	Gets live weather information from an online weather service.

•	Connects to the internet using Java to collect weather data.

•	Reads data that is received in JSON format.

•	Converts raw weather data into meaningful information.

•	Shows weather details clearly in the console.

•	Handles errors safely so the program does not crash.

# Languages and Tools Used

•	Java – The primary programming language used to build the entire application. Java provides robustness, platform independence, and strong support for networking and API-based development.

•	JSON Library – Used to parse, read, and manipulate JSON data received from the weather API. It plays a crucial role in converting raw API responses into usable information.

•	Java Development Kit (JDK) – Required for compiling and running the Java source files. It provides essential tools like the Java compiler and runtime environment.

•	IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA) – Used during development for writing code, managing files, debugging errors, and improving productivity.

•	Command Prompt / Terminal – Used to compile and execute the program outside the IDE, helping users understand how Java programs run in real environments.

•	Weather API Service – An external online service that provides live weather data accessed through HTTP requests.

# Platforms Used

•	Windows Operating System – Used as the primary development and execution environment.

•	Java Virtual Machine (JVM) – Enables platform-independent execution, allowing the program to run on any system that supports Java.

•	Console-Based Platform – The application runs completely in the command line, requiring minimal system resources and no graphical interface.

 # Applications 

•  Can be used to check current weather conditions.

•  Helpful for students learning Java and API integration.

•  Useful in travel planning to know weather conditions in advance.

•  Can support farmers by providing basic weather information.

•  Helpful in transport and delivery planning affected by weather.

•  Can be used as a base for weather-related software projects.

# CONCLUSION

This project serves as a practical introduction to API integration using Java. By combining core Java concepts with real-time data retrieval, it helps learners move beyond basic programs and explore how modern applications communicate with external services. The project is beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and highly relevant for students aiming to build a strong foundation in backend and web-based development.
